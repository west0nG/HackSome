"""Neutral runtime contract (07-07 codex-runtime, design §2).

Every caller (resident Agent loop, ephemeral runner, loadout materializer, and
provisioner) faces ONLY this model; CLI details — argv, output parsing,
session continuation, credentials, home materialization — live in exactly
one adapter file per runtime (claude_code.py, codex.py). Extension rules:

  - a capability BOTH runtimes need → extend RunRequest/RunResult + implement
    once per adapter; callers change at most once;
  - a runtime-specific flag → touch only that adapter file;
  - a new caller → depends on this module only, never on a concrete adapter.

Session-continuation semantics (design §4): the "session id" is whatever
token the ADAPTER returns in RunResult.session_token — claude echoes its own
pre-set uuid, codex returns the CLI-assigned thread id. The interface never
assumes a caller can DICTATE the id (codex cannot pre-set one — upstream open
issue); RunRequest.session_hint is a best-effort preference adapters may
ignore, RunResult.session_token is the only authoritative value.
