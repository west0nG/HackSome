"""Codex runtime adapter — the ONLY place that knows the `codex` CLI.

argv (design §4; verified live against codex-cli 0.142.5 on 2026-07-07 — the
JSONL fixtures under tests/fixtures/codex/ are real captures, not hand-written):

    first wake:  codex exec "<prompt>" --json --skip-git-repo-check \
                   -c developer_instructions="<charter>" \
                   [-m <model>] [-c model_reasoning_effort="<effort>"] \
                   --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
                   --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust
    resume:      codex exec resume <thread-id> "<prompt>" --json ... (same flags)

Key runtime facts this adapter encodes (all fixture/live-verified):

  - session continuation: codex CANNOT pre-set a thread id (upstream open
    issues #13242/#15271/#15767), so RunRequest.session_hint is IGNORED — the
    only continuation token is the thread id the CLI assigns and emits via
    `thread.started`. `exec resume` RE-EMITS `thread.started` with the SAME
    thread id, so parse_output takes session_token from that event uniformly
    on both branches.
  - `item.completed` items with item.type=="error" can be NON-FATAL warnings
    (e.g. the skills context-budget notice) — a turn that still ends in
    `turn.completed` is a success. NEVER fail on error items alone.
  - a real failure emits a top-level `{"type":"error"}` event AND a final
    `turn.failed` (and exits non-zero): ok = saw turn.completed and no
    turn.failed / top-level error. The exit code is deliberately NOT consulted
    for ok — codex publishes no exit-code enumeration and SIGINT once returned
    0 (issue #4721); the event stream is authoritative (same stance as the
    claude adapter's is_error rule).
  - no dollar cost field: `turn.completed.usage` carries token counts only
    (input/cached_input/output/reasoning_output) → cost_usd is always None,
    usage passes through natively.
  - MCP: no per-invocation config flag — servers ride the per-role
    CODEX_HOME/config.toml that materialize_home renders from the SAME
    agents/mcp/<role>.json the claude adapter passes via --mcp-config. An
    isolated CODEX_HOME is naturally strict (nothing else can be picked up).
  - `-c key=value` values are TOML-parsed by codex (invalid TOML falls back to
    a raw string). We always pass a valid TOML basic string: json.dumps with
    ensure_ascii=False emits exactly the escape set TOML basic strings accept,
    so ANY charter text (newlines, quotes, CJK) survives verbatim.
  - `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` (--yolo) is the official
    posture inside an externally hardened container (Landlock is unavailable
    in unprivileged containers) — mapped from bypass_permissions, omitted when
    False (parallel to claude's --dangerously-skip-permissions handling).
  - `--skip-git-repo-check` is unconditional: the agent workdir is not a git
    repo and codex refuses to run there without it.
  - hooks (07-09 codex-hooks, live-verified on 0.142.5): CODEX_HOME/hooks.json
    is ISOMORPHIC to claude's settings.json `hooks` key (same event → matcher
    groups → handlers shape, same Stop stdin/stdout contract incl.
    stop_hook_active), so materialize_home reuses the neutral merge/remove
    helpers from loadout.py. WITHOUT `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` codex
    SILENTLY skips every hook in headless --json (no warning anywhere), and
    hook trust cannot be pre-seeded non-interactively → build_argv passes the
    flag UNCONDITIONALLY (design §4).
