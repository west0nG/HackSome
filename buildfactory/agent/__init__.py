"""Foundagent Agent layer — single-agent capability + execution wrapper.

Turns the VM layer's "a bare CLI agent process inside a container" into a
declarable, task-runnable, runtime-swappable, skill/hook/prompt-loadable
single-agent abstraction. This layer owns ONE agent's capability + exec
interface only; multi-agent scheduling/teardown belongs to the orchestration
layer (it reuses VM-layer computer-use / browser / account-injection / proxy /
observability — never re-building them).
