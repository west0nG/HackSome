"""Loadout neutral core: skills copy + manifest reconcile (AG4 / D6).

Runtime-NEUTRAL half of home materialization (07-07 codex-runtime split): the
skills-copy and the bookkeeping-manifest reconcile know nothing about which
runtime's home they land in — the claude adapter points them at
<claude_home>/skills, the codex adapter at its own skills dir. The runtime-
specific steps (claude's settings.json, codex's config.toml) live in each
adapter's materialize_home (agent/runtimes/*). The hooks helpers below are
neutral too (07-09 codex-hooks): they operate on ANY JSON file with a
top-level `hooks` key — claude's settings.json and codex's hooks.json share
that shape verbatim (event → matcher groups → handlers, live-verified on
codex-cli 0.142.5), so both adapters call the same three functions.

Reconcile (07-03 company-loadout-overlay): the home persists across restarts,
so "off" must UNDO what a previous run materialized. materialize_home keeps a
bookkeeping manifest <home>/.loadout-manifest.json recording what THE LOADOUT
itself put there — the skill names it copied and the hook ENTRIES it merged
(per event; the hook values are runtime-shaped and opaque to this core). Each
run first deletes skills in (previous manifest − current spec) and lets the
adapter value-remove previously merged hook entries. Anything NOT in the
manifest (agent-installed skills, agent-added settings keys/entries) is NEVER
touched. No/corrupt manifest = empty manifest → add-only, safe for first runs
and pre-feature homes.
